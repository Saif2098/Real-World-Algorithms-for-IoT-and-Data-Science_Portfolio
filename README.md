# Real-World-Algorithms-for-IoT-and-Data-Science-Portfolio

ECE/CS 434 Real-World Algorithms for IoT and Data Science (formally called Mobile Computing and Applications) [Course Notion Page](https://rrc-uiuc.notion.site/Real-World-Algorithms-for-IoT-and-Data-Science-74d8f612f74a4c1689760dafa31ef93d)


This course focuses on math and algorithms in the context of applications. Some of the applications are as follows:
- DUET source separation algorithm (mixing matrix, underdetermined system, DUET algorithm)
- Frequency Modulation Continuous Wave (FMCW)
- 3D pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithms (IMU data, 3D orientation)
- Unsupervised Localization (UnLoc iterative algorithm, maximum likelihood estimator / MLE)
- Beamforming, AoA: Delay sum (Radiation pattern, near and  far field, delay and sum, AoA)
- Beamforming: GCC, MUSIC & Minimum Variance Distortion-less (MVDR beamformer, Sub-space methods, spatial smoothing)
- Time of Flight (ToF) estimation (ToF from two-way ranging, clock drift,  3-way ranging, ADS-TWR)
- Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
- Kalman Filters
- Dynamic Time Warping
